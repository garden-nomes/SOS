P12-21

P12	(See chpt8p12.jpg)

P13	Keep a hash of each block withing the .torrent file.  After each block
	finishes downloading, hash it and check against the hash in the torrent.
	If they don't match, discard the block and request it again.

P14	Because a MAC ensures protection from a person-in-the-middle attach
	where Trudy knows the hash function and replaces (m, H(m)) with
	(m', H(m')).

P15	If both people are required to authenticate each other, Trudy can wait
	until she receives Bob's nonce and then send the same nonce back. Bob will
	encrypt the nonce and return it to trudy, so Trudy can return that same
	encrypted nonce (which is also a cipher of Bob's nonce).

P16	a (See chpt8p16a.jpg)

	b	Trudy forwards "I am Alice", but replaces Alice's public key with Trudy's
		public key.  Trudy then intercepts the nonce and forwards it to Alice,
		but replaces Alice's encrypted nonce with the same nonce encrypte with
		Trudy's private key.

P17	(See chpt8p17.jpg)

P18	a	No, unfortunately Alice has no certificate and therefore no way
		to guarantee that it is her.

	b	Yes, Alice can encrypt her message (or a hash of it) with Bob's
		public key so that Bob (and only Bob) can decrypt it.

P19	a	The client
	b	216.75.194.220, port 443
	c	283
	d	3
	e	The EMS
	f	bc and 9b
	g	4 records - client hello plus the three in the packet
	h	5 records, server hello, certificate, server hello done, change cipher spec,
		and the encrypted hanshake record itself

P20	She can't; TCP keeps track of it's own record numbers and won't accept any
	out-of-sequence packets.

P21	No, it won't pass the SSL MAC check.
