Chapter 8

R4		A chosen-paintext attack.

R6		They need (sum of 1 to N) keys, one for each pair of people.
		In the case of public keys, the need 2N keys: one public key and one private key for
		each person.

R9		Checksums do no provide quite as thorough protection against corruption.  It's much
		easier for a checksum to miss a corruption in the data, whereas it's extremely to
		generate a value that will compute to the same hash.

R10		No, the hash reduces the message so that there isn't enough information to recreate
		the source text from the hash.

P2		If 7 letters are known, then only (26-7=)19 pairings remain.

		19! = ~10^17
		10^26 - 10^17 = 10^9

P8	a.	n = 5 * 11 = 55
		z = 4 * 10 = 40

	b.	because 3 is relatively prime to 40

	c.	d = 27 (3 * 27 = 81 and 81 mod 40 = 1)

	d.	8^3 mod 55 = 512 mod 55 = 17

P9	a.	S = (g^SA)^SB mod p = g^(SA + SB) mod p
		S' = (g^SB)^SA mod p = g^(SB + SA) mod p

	b.	TA = 2^5 mod 11 = 32 mod 11 = 10
		TB = 12^5 mod 11 = 248,832 mod 11 = 1

	c.	S = 1^5 mod 11 = 1

P10	a.	A(S)

	b.	B(A, S)
