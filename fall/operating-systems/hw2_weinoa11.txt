a.
						1 job		2 jobs			4 jobs
Turnaround time: 		NT			NT				2NT
Throughput:				1/N jobs/T	2/N jobs/T		2/N jobs/T
Processor utilization:	50%			100%			100%

Processor utilization:	50%			100%			100%

2.2

Because the scheduling algorithm favors processes that have used little processor time recently, it is likely to choose I/O bound programs.  However, if processor bound processes are frequently ignored, then they will have used less processing time and be chosen again by the scheduler.

2.3

For a multiprogrammed batch system you might prioritize processes based on I/O usage as in 2.2 in order to maximize throughput.  However, with time-slicing fairness is more of a concern, so you might want to use a time-slicing system to ensure more turnover.

2.4

System calls allow user processes to request certain things from the kernel.  This allows for a seperation of user- and kernel-mode processes.  User processes can be restricted from accessing certain areas of memory or running certain commands, but when nessecary can request to do so at the kernel's discretion.
