a. min[ 500 kb/s, 2 Mb/s, 1 Mb/s ] = 500 kb/s

b. 4,000,000 bytes = 4000 kb
   4000 kb / 500 kb/s = 8 s

c. min [ 500 kb/s, 100 kb/s, 1 Mb/s ] = 100 kb/s
   4000 kb / 100 kb/s = 40 s

R1
E-mail: SMTP
Git: HTTPS/SSH
Web browsing: HTTP/HTTPS
File Transfer: FTP/SSH
P2P File Distribution: BitTorrent

R3
The process that initiates the communication is the client, and the process that waits to be communicated with is the server.

R5
An IP address and a port number.

R7
A remote surgery application.

R9
SSL operates at the application layer.  The programmer includes the SSL libraries in both the server and client processes, and uses those libraries to access sockets.

R11
HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and POP3 all require no data loss.

R13
Web caching reduces the delay by requiring the server to send only a "page not modified" response, which is typically much smaller than the content of the page.

Web caching will only affect pages that are already cached, though, so not all page requests are affected.

R15
Because FTP keeps two channels open on different sockets, one for control information and one for file transfer.

P1

a. False, the client will have to send multiple request messages for the images.
b. True, if the server is configured for persistent connects and the requests are sent back-to-back.
c.
