R7	So that the link can forward packets without contacting the centralized routing
	processor for each packet.

R16	Assuming 20-byte TCP and IP headers, each packet will about 50% data and 50% headers.

P3	VC Network:
		Incoming interface: the link the packet arrived from
		Incoming VC #: the virtual circuit number the packet is stamped with
		Outgoing interface: the link to send the packet to
		Outgoing VC #: the virtual circuit number to stamp the packet with (replacing
			the incoming VC #)

	Datagram Network:
		Prefix: the router matches the address with the longest prefix that can can describe
			it.
		Link interface: the output link to forward the packet to

P4	a.

		1110 0000 0100 0000		1

	b.
		11001000 10010001 01010001 01010101
			The address matches none of the prefixes, so it is sent to 3.

		11100001 01000000 11000011 00111100
			The address matches the third prefix in the table, so it is sent to 2.

		11100001 10000000 00010001 01110111
			The address matches the fourth entry in the table, so it goes to 3.
