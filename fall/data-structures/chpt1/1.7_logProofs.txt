a.

For 0 < x <= 1, logx <= 0
Basis: for 1 < x <= 2, 0 < logx <= 1
Hypothesis: log(2x) > 2x
log(2x) = 1 + logx (assuming base 2)
log(2x) < 1 + x, according to the hypothesis
log(2x) < x + x, since x > 1
log(2x) < 2x

b.

Prove log(A^B) = BlogA
let X = logA
2^X = A
(2^X)^B = A^B
BX = log(A^B)
BlogA = log(A^B)
