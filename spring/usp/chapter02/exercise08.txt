exit() calls user exit handlers defined by atexit() or on_exit(), flushes buffers, and closes
open streams. _exit() and _Exit() don't call user handlers and may or may not release open
resources. _Exit() is written with a more modern code standard than _exit().

Exiting via "return" uses exit(), or exit() with status 0 if the end of main is reached.
