## Problem 10.1

> Show that the greedy algorithm to minimize the mean completion time for
> multiprocessor job scheduling works.

The textbook shows that for the single-processor case, the smallest total cost
for a job sequence is given by ordering the jobs by time, smallest to largest.
Cycling the jobs between processors ensures jobs assigned to a processor will
arrive with this same ordering. Therefore each processor is given an optimum
sequence.

## Problem 10.2

> The input is a set of jobs j1,j2,...,jN, each of which takes one time unit to
> complete. Each job ji earns di dollars if it is completed by the time limit
> ti, but no money if completed after the time limit.

> a. Give an O(N2) greedy algorithm to solve the problem.

> b. Modify your algorithm to obtain an O(N log N) time bound. (Hint: The time
> bound is due entirely to sorting the jobs by money. The rest of the algorithm
> can be implemented, using the disjoint set data structure, in o(N log N).)

```C++
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct job {
    int di, ti;

    friend bool operator<(const job & lhs, const job & rhs) {
        return lhs.di < rhs.di;
    }
};

std::vector<job> *optimal_job_ordering(std::vector<job> jobs) {
    std::vector<job> *ret = new std::vector<job>();
    int i, j, time = 0;

    /* std::sort's documentation promises an average nlogn operations */
    std::sort(jobs.begin(), jobs.end());

    while (!jobs.empty()) {
        i = jobs.size() - 1;
        x = std::max(time + 1, jobs[i].ti);

        for (j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            /* if we can do job j, and still have time to job i (and any other
             * i's we might have had before) then do job j instead */
            if (jobs[j].ti < x + 1) {
                x = jobs[j].ti + 1;
                i = j;
            }
        }

        ret.push_back(jobs[i]);
        jobs.erase(jobs.begin() + i);
        time++;
    }

    return ret;
}
```

## Problem 10.6

> Show that if the symbols are sorted by frequency, Huffmanâ€™s algorithm can be
> implemented in linear time.

* Start with the sorted list of symbols and an empty queue of weighted tree
  nodes.

* While the list isn't empty or the queue is larger than 1:

    * Grab the smallest element from the front of either the list or queue, twice.

    * Merge those two elements into a new tree node.

    * Enqueue the newly created tree node.

* The only tree node in the queue is the root of the Huffman tree.

## Problem 10.10

> Explain how to implement first fit and best fit in O(N log N) time.

By using a self-balancing binary search tree (such as a red-black tree) sorted
on bin weight, you can implement both algorithms in *O(n log n)* time, since
operations on the tree are *O(log n)*.
